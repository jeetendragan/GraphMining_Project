Data-Set: US air transport network
Description: The network of travel connections among the 500 airports
             in US with the largest amount of traffic. An edge exists
             between two nodes if there is a direct flight between the
             corresponding airports. Each edge has associated an
             integer weight corresponding to the total number of seats
             available on all the direct routes between the two
             endpoints within a year.
