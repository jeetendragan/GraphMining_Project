# GraphMining_Project
GM Project

Finding dense structures within large-scale graphs is an integral part of graph analysis. The k-core and k-truss of a graph are popular metrics to identify these dense subgraphs. In this project, we discuss how coreness and truss can be applied to weighted graphs using h-index algorithms. The localized nature of our algorithms offer high scalability due to its parallelizable features, unlike traditional peeling algorithms.
